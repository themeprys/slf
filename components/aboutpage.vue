                <p class="col-lg-10 fs-4"><strong>Singaraja Literary Festival (SLF)</strong> is a cultural initiative
                    dedicated to documenting and revitalizing the intellectual wealth and literary traditions of
                    Singaraja, Bali. Known for <strong>Gedong Kirtya</strong>, the first and oldest lontar manuscript
                    library in Bali, Singaraja holds an invaluable literary heritage.</p>
                <p class="col-lg-10 fs-4">SLF aims to create spaces for dialogue, listening, and appreciation by
                    exploring Balinese lontar manuscripts, hosting literacy discussions, cultural performances, and
                    adapting literary works into theater and film. We believe literature is a bridge connecting the
                    past, present, and future, enabling modern generations to deeply understand their cultural heritage.
